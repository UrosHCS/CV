**About me:**
As a software developer with 6 years of experience, I have always pushed myself to ship the highest quality code that I could. While I co-founded a startup in the past, I have since realized that my true passion lies in technical roles. I am dedicated to staying current with industry advancements and am eager to make a positive impact through my work in software development.
